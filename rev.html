I would like to thank Krunal, Rahul and Rafiq for motivating us throughout and keeping us entertained when we were at the campsite. It never felt as if they were the guides and they were different from us. They were also a part of the huge family. </div>

The most striking point here would be, we learnt to care and share with those whom we are not attached to and that makes a big difference.  Unknown

                    <p>This is my first Himalayan Trek and it went amazing.&#128525</p>
                    <p>When I was washing my dishes with cold water I realized and felt deeply - how difficult it is for ladies in our houses to wash dishes at night with such cold water. I gained empathy here.
                    I cried twice watching sunrise and sunset during our 4 days trek - I dont know why but I felt the beauty of nature deep within my soul.
                    A groupmate of mine was having difficulty climbing and she felt like giving up on trek 3-4 times but she didnt give up and made it to the top. I realized how damn strong willpower she has. I felt proud to be part of such a strong tribe.
                    <p>I strongly felt that campassgalaxy safety is of global standards.</p>

                    <p>Overall the trek was an incredible experience. Especially considering the pandemic I didn't expect to feel so safe. But the IH team ensured that all the precautions were in place. We had a great time from Day 0 with stargazing, delicious food and a comfortable stay.&nbsp;<br />
                    The trek itself was exhilarating and very rewarding.&#128523; All the campsites were in beautiful locations and I particularly liked the commitment towards cleaning the trail. It felt good to know that I was leaving it in a better state than before.&nbsp;<br />
                    We couldnt interact with the kitchen staff because of the social distancing norms but I want to mention that the food was great on all days.</p>
                    <p>Vijeet is a great trek leader and taught us so many things in the short duration of this trek. We had conversations on constellations, forests, and everything in between. There was always the emphasis on sustainability while trekking which is something all of us will keep in mind going forward. The cherry on top was all his stories from the mountains which meant there was never a dull moment on the trek.</p>

                        <p>The trek went smoothly with some bumps along the way &#128151;. I admire the determination and commitment of the India Hikes team to organize such a trek in pandemic times. There were some operational issues although. The dining tent was something, I felt was needed the most. Since everybody got themselves tested before the trek, it would not make sense to practice social distancing on treks at high altitudes. We also tried to reduce our contact with locals as much as possible. Overall, campassgalaxy never fails to impress me with their professionalism and good trek leaders.</p>
                        <p>I would like to thank Dhaval Jajjal for being a good trek leader. He is very passionate about the things he does. Also, Mr. Ravi was very supportive and pumped us before we left for the trek.</p>

                            <p>The trek was awesome and the safety regulations taken as it was Corona time was simply stunning. Please change the pick-up point to Ashrey Sagar restaurant near Railway station. This is a much much better restaurant and Hotel compared to Grand legaccy. Room rates are cheaper(INR 900) compared to Grand legacy (INR 1500).</p>
                            <p>The trek was awesome and the safety regulations taken as it was Corona time was simply stunning. &#128519;Trek leader Dhaval ji took extreme care in ensuring that every member&#39;s pulse oximeter reading is taken without fail (even at 4300 mts). Below things standout clearly.<br />
                            1. Green Trails Idea was awesome. It inspired the trekkers to collect small garbage and IH time ensured that it is collected and segregated properly in base-camp.<br />
                            2.The Trek leaders have the Idea of Servant leadership. This was clearly evident from ,how our trek leader Dhaval organized himself and always keeping the team above than himself.<br />
                            3.Food was awesome all through the Trek.&#128523; Special attention was given to the quality. Thanks.</p>

                            <p>HI,<br />
                            The trek went really well and we really had a great time. couple of small changes suggested</p>
                            <p>1 Your website mentions that BSNL and vodafone netwrok is there in sankri but thats not the case.Only BSNL netwrok comes that too between 4-6 am at some spots only. There is no signal after purola.</p>
                            <p>2 Your website says that Har ki dun trek is easy flat walks with the fact that you have to walk 10 km daily on an average whereas there are regular ascents and every now and then. Would recommend to make this slight change to give the trekers a more realisitic perspective.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>The entire team of india hikes was really very warm and helpful throughout our trek and stay at sankri but my special words for the TL Krupa and the Guide Manu. They both were very nice and always smiling.<br />
                            They belong to that class who enjoy their work.&#128525;</p>

The calmest person on the trek , who got us back from the panic zone to comfort zone whenever we had headache or felt low or any discomfort. The activities he made us to play as part of the team build was just perfect for the team to feel as a family at the end of 3rd day.</p>
                                <p>Just in 3 days experienced whole lot of different world.&#128522;<br />

                                    Even if we are about to make few sudden decision due to climatic conditions or due to the difficulty of reaching the summit, Our trek leader Anuj did it very wisely. He was so cool and handled everything so patiently and efficiently. He maintained timings perfectly and planned accordingly so that we can reach the summit within the time. He was constantly encouraging and boosting all of us throughout the trail.</p>

                                        <p>HI Team,</p>
                                        <p>Very thankful for the trek that we just completed. It was fantastic experience and India Hikes team ensured that we become reach in our experience. Everything was 10/10 from day one to the last day.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>Our experience in pitching tents will be helpful for life time and in all my upcoming treks which I do in sahyadri range. All the instructions given by trek leader Anuj were helpful and he ensured that everything falls in place as per schedule. Trek leaders Baldev and Sunil were equally good and they support both fast pacers and slow movers like me. Everything was on time starting from morning tea, breakfast, Lunch &amp; Dinner. I did not came across any delay on all the days. Pitching tents on ice was my first experience. When we decided that we have to sleep on tents pitched on ice, the thought going through mind was that our sleep is going to miserable, but our we got our best sleep on the ice pitched tents. It was wonderful.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>One thing which stands out is food. The Quality and Test.&#128522; This is one of the reason that i did not loose any weight on this trek. I was expecting to loose at least 10 KG. But sadly not even a gram. Harpalji is awesome cook and my reason to go on multiple treks with you guys in future.&nbsp;</p>

                                            <p>Best part of campassgalaxy is that they got us through the fresh trails while making to the summit.&nbsp;</p>
                                            <p>From the moment I reached Katgoan, i was&nbsp;skeptical as a beginner.&#128539; But after meeting Leo Saldanha, Saini and Mukesh while the trek, things placed very well. The day of the summit was very tough. It was never-ending, at one point, I had almost given up with the negative thoughts that I had. But Mukesh, Leo and Saini motivated me and therefore, I could complete this trek. The moment I reach the summit, I cried like a baby. &nbsp;The fact that trekkers who were little slow were&nbsp;placed first while trekking, which showed their priority of working at a team and keeping all together and completing the summit. I felt safe. &nbsp;After completing, the descent was super fun, we played antakshari and we dint realized we were about to reach the base camp. We all wanted that this journey continues for days and days. Well, at last, heartfelt gratitude to all them, also those who cooked food for us, the persons carrying our bags and the entire team who contributed this trek for its success.&nbsp;</p>
                                            <p>The discipline and the safety was the utmost priority (Commendable) for &nbsp;Leo Saldanha and so the whole group followed the instructions. This made the trek enjoyable. I loved the knowledge sessions and activities being played by Leo. The trek was an eye-opener for the fact that as an individual one can contribute to preserving the nature and so much for self-reflection. &nbsp;The green trail initiative is good work. We all had this personal bond with each other at the end of the trek. Leo and his team will always remain an inspiration for us - the city people. It has taught us lessons and self-realization that cannot be put into words. This will remain long life with me.&nbsp;</p>

                                                        <p>Awesome!</p>
                                                        <p>The trek was planned to the last tee. The pace of the trek, the graded increase in altitude, the campsite facilities everything was well planned. What was more amazing is the team that IH has.</p>
                                                        <p>It started out with wanting to &quot;conquer&quot; the heights.&#128539; It was only a couple of weeks before our trek that Brahmatal witnessed immense snow that a few of the earlier groups could not make it to the summit. Snow was predicted for the 1st of January and it could have been anybody&#39;s guess how the weather will play out. We were in for a delight when we had good weather all through the trek that we could reach the summit and were treated to a snow fall on the day we left Lohajung. The trek ended with a great sense of gratitude for having been bestowed such an experience and with the sense of wanting to conquer subdued.&nbsp;The mountains have a lovely way of inculcating humility.&nbsp;Hospitality at every campsite at those heights and God forbid weather was impeccable. The quality of food is not mentioned. Hot, tasty, healthy food with good variety ensured that not one of us lost weight despite climbing 12,250 ft.</p>
                                                        <p>We got to see trekkers from other trekking companies in some camp sites and on the way to the summit. They played loud music, some smoked, and a few were loud and disturbing the tranquility of the place. I realized the effect of your communication strategy about responsible trekking right from the first mail that you send.&nbsp;</p>
                                                        <p>IH trekkers stood apart as responsible wanting the leave the place at least as pristine as it is if not better. The eco bag that all of us carried was a constant reminder about our responsibility, lest we get carried away.</p>
                                                        <p>The stories and experiences that Pradyumna and Kundan Chacha shared over the 4-day trek were amazing and entertaining.&nbsp;</p>
