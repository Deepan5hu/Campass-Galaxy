    <div class="accordion-item">
    <h3>Has trekking restarted?</h3>
    <div class="content">
    <p>Yes,treks have restarted! We're happy to tell you that from the beginning of October 2020, we have restarted Himalayan treks. Several teams have already gone on treks and returned safely, having had wonderfully meaningful experiences with us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion-item">
    <h3>Which treks are open in winter?</h3>
    <div class="content">
    <p>We have reopened Himalayan treks and announced dates for winter treks too. In fact, almost all our dates are half full already.</p>
    <p>Here is a list of winter treks that we have opened. These treks have dates available in December, January and February.</p>

    <h3>How is Indiahikes keeping my trek safe during COVID-19?</h3>
    <div class="content">
    <p>At Indiahikes, we make no compromises when it comes to safety. Since its inception Indiahikes has pioneered as well as established safety protocols that are strictly implemented across all treks.</p>
    <p>In COVID times this attention to safety has been significantly amplified. After much research, brainstorming, and consultation with experts we have come up with a 31 point safety check.</p>

    <div class="accordion-item">
    <h3>Should I do a COVID Test before my trek?</h3>
    <div class="content">
    <p>It is not mandatory for you to do a COVID test before coming on your trek. The Uttarakhand state government has removed the requirement for a COVID test.</p>
    <p>At Indiahikes, we strongly recommend doing an RT-PCR test before coming on your trek, because it reduces the probability of coming to these remote regions as carriers of the virus.</p>
    <p>But we understand that in some cities, it is difficult to get the test done at will. So we have not made it a mandatory requirement. You will, however, need to bring a basic medical certificate, which has been mandatory for all our treks for the past 10 years.</p>

    <div class="accordion-item">
    <h3>What's your cancellation policy during COVID-19?</h3>
    <div class="content">
    <p>In light of COVID-19, since travel and treks are uncertain, Indiahikes has waived off all cancellation charges if you register for a trek before Dec 31. Which means, for all registrations before Dec 31, even if the trek is in December or later, apart from the basic 4% transaction charges, there are no cancellation charges from Indiahikes.</p>
    <p>This helps you to register for a trek with peace of mind, knowing you can cancel your trek even until the last moment. Trekkers have started registering for treks, and we'd like you to do so with full confidence. We don't want you to worry about losing out through cancellations.</p>

    <h3>Can I join your treks as a solo trekker?</h3>
    <div class="content">
    <p>Yes, absolutely. Many solo trekkers join our teams and have wonderful experiences. They end up meeting like-minded people on the trek and don�t feel like they have come alone on the trek any more.</p>
    <p>Our pre-trek experience team ensures that you know your entire team well much before you actually head out on the trek.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we have several women trekkers who join us solo as well because of the safety they get with the Indiahikes team. You�re welcome to join us as a solo trekker too.</p>

    <h3>What kind of food do you provide?</h3>
    <div class="content">
    <p>We provide simple, delicious, nutritious vegetarian meals on all days of the trek.</p>
    <p>Indiahikes provides Indian vegetarian food. Your typical meal will consist of roti (Indian bread), sabzi (vegetable), dal (lentils) and rice. Add to it a sumptuous dessert. (Psst... Many of our trekkers tell us they want to trek again simply for the food we serve.)</p>
    <p>We serve three meals a day-breakfast, lunch and dinner. Apart from that, you'll get tea and snacks in the evening and a hot cup of soup before dinner. If you're in for a long day of trekking, you'll get a packed snack as well.</p>
    <p>Our menu is designed after elaborate research on nutritional requirements for trekkers. We take the exercise put in, the altitude gained and the weather you,ll face into consideration before putting each meal together. You�ll notice that every meal is nutritionally well-balanced with the right amount of carbs, protein, vitamins, fibre and calories.</p>
    <p>Add to that the expertise of our cooks. They've all undergone intensive training to be where they are. The meals they dish out will have you licking your fingers!</p>
