<h3>How is Indiahikes keeping my trek safe during COVID-19?</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>At Indiahikes, we make no compromises when it comes to safety. Since its inception Indiahikes has pioneered as well as established safety protocols that are strictly implemented across all treks.</p>

<h3>Should I do a COVID Test before my trek?</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>It is not mandatory for you to do a COVID test before coming on your trek. The Uttarakhand state government has removed the requirement for a COVID test.</p>
<p>At Indiahikes, we strongly recommend doing an RT-PCR test before coming on your trek, because it reduces the probability of coming to these remote regions as carriers of the virus.</p>
<p>But we understand that in some cities, it is difficult to get the test done at will. So we have not made it a mandatory requirement. You will, however, need to bring a basic medical certificate, which has been mandatory for all our treks for the past 10 years.</p>

<h3>What�s your cancellation policy during COVID-19?</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>In light of COVID-19, since travel and treks are uncertain, Indiahikes has waived off all cancellation charges if you register for a trek before Dec 31. Which means, for all registrations before Dec 31, even if the trek is in December or later, apart from the basic 4% transaction charges, there are no cancellation charges from Indiahikes.</p>
<p>This helps you to register for a trek with peace of mind, knowing you can cancel your trek even until the last moment. Trekkers have started registering for treks, and we�d like you to do so with full confidence. We don�t want you to worry about losing out through cancellations.</p>

<h3>Can I join your treks as a solo trekker?</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>Yes, absolutely. Many solo trekkers join our teams and have wonderful experiences. They end up meeting like-minded people on the trek and don�t feel like they have come alone on the trek any more.</p>
<p>Our pre-trek experience team ensures that you know your entire team well much before you actually head out on the trek.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have several women trekkers who join us solo as well because of the safety they get with the Indiahikes team. You�re welcome to join us as a solo trekker too.</p>

<h3>What kind of food do you provide?</h3>
<div class="content">
<p>We provide simple, delicious, nutritious vegetarian meals on all days of the trek.</p>
<p>Indiahikes provides Indian vegetarian food. Your typical meal will consist of roti (Indian bread), sabzi (vegetable), dal (lentils) and rice. Add to it a sumptuous dessert. (Psst� Many of our trekkers tell us they want to trek again simply for the food we serve.)</p>
<p>We serve three meals a day � breakfast, lunch and dinner. Apart from that, you�ll get tea and snacks in the evening and a hot cup of soup before dinner. If you�re in for a long day of trekking, you�ll get a packed snack as well.</p>
<p>Our menu is designed after elaborate research on nutritional requirements for trekkers. We take the exercise put in, the altitude gained and the weather you�ll face into consideration before putting each meal together. You�ll notice that every meal is nutritionally well-balanced with the right amount of carbs, protein, vitamins, fibre and calories.</p>
<p>Add to that the expertise of our cooks. They�ve all undergone intensive training to be where they are. The meals they dish out will have you licking your fingers!</p>
